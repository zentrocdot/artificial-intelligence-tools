# Artificial Intelligence Tools

## Introductory Words

<p align="justify">This is a repository for artificial intelligence tools. At the moment one can find only some <code>Bash</code> scripts in this repository. Some time ago I started using AI for image generation. I make NFTs for myself from a few selected AI-generated images. This repository contains scripts or programs that I use to simplify my work both when generating AI images and when minting NFTS.</p> 

## Software in Use

<p align="justify">I am currently using <code>Stable Diffusion</code> [3] as AI Generator and <code>Easy Diffusion</code> [2] and <code>AUTOMATIC1111</code> [1] as AI Web UI.</p>
