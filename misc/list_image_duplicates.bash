# Prerequisite:
#     Installation of package findimagedupes:
#     sudo apt-get install findimagedupes
#
# Description:
# findimagedupes finds one or more duplicates of the same or a similar image.
# The output of findimagedupes returns the entire path to a duplicate. This
# makes the output of findimagedupes unreadable. This script reads each output
# line of findimagedupes with the duplicates in a loop. The script loops over
# the specified string array. Then the file name is extracted from the path.
# Each set of duplicates is printed line by line. When the script is finished,
# it prints out how many duplicate images were found.
